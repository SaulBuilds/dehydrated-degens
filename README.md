Remember, this guide is a starting point. Explore the documentation and tutorials linked above to deepen your understanding.





This is a [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com) + [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-rainbowkit`](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/packages/create-rainbowkit).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
